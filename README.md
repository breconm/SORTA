# Sorta

**Sorta** is a sleek, minimalist shopping list app built for simplicity and control. Designed for both **web** and **mobile**, Sorta helps users organize items by **category** (e.g., groceries, cosmetics, clothing) and **store** (e.g., Target, Amazon, local shops) — all with just a few taps.

## Features (Frontend MVP)

- **Category View**  
  Quickly browse your saved items by category (Groceries, Clothing, etc.).

- **Store View**  
  See what you need from each store — perfect for planning trips or orders.

- **Add Item UI**  
  A fast and intuitive form to add items with name, category, store, and link.

- **Icon-Based Tab Navigation**  
  Minimalist bottom tab bar for easy navigation across screens.

- **Lightweight & Minimalist Design**  
  Inspired by tools like Notion, Google Keep, and Apple Reminders.
