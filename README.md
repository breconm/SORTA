# Sorted

**Sorted** is a sleek, minimalist shopping list app built for simplicity and control. Designed for both **web** and **mobile**, Sorta helps users organize items by **category** (e.g., groceries, cosmetics, clothing) and **store** (e.g., Target, Amazon, local shops) — all with just a few taps.
